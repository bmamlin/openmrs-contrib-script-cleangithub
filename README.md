# openmrs-contrib-script-cleangithub

A simple script for cleaning up the GitHub repos for OpenMRS. This uses my [GitHub API](https://github.com/bmamlin/GitHubApi.groovy) to run and it obviously requires appropriate permissions on GitHub. I'm sharing it here for a few reasons: (1) for others with similar privileges within OpenMRS to use if they wish or for us to setup an automated process to do these tasks, (2) an easy way to ensure I don't lose this code, and (3) in the miniscule chance that it might help someone with some unrelated task.
